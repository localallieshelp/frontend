description: "About Local Allies"
copy: "Local Allies was created to help independent small businesses be equipped with the tools to thrive in a quickly-changing digital and difficult landscape. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we witnessed volunteers from across the nation create donation campaigns and provide assistance in any way they could from creating social media groups made to uplift small merchants to those regularly buying takeout meals from local mom-and-pop restaurants. "
copy2: "Inspired by these acts of compassion, we set out to create the volunteer-led Local Allies program to set up a sustainable next step for small businesses in need. This includes a specialized website that provides a free hub to input their small business information; create donation programs where all funds go back to the business; and a helpful staff of experienced volunteers of marketers, translators, and web developers to provide complimentary consultation and suggestions on other ways to help.*"
copy3: "Special thanks to Send Chinatown Love and the Little Tokyo Service Center for their inspiration and assistance!"
copy4: "*Please note, in order to best help those business owners most in need, only small, non-franchised businesses of less than 50 employees with little to no digital/social media presence may participate. If you do not qualify, we will still be glad to help direct you to other services for additional assistance."
